Trivial assembler for nopCPU. Licensed under the CDDL license.
For more details, see the COPYING file.

Syntax: [instruction] [registerOperands] {memoryAddress}
(registerOperands has to have the form regA,regB, *WITHOUT* any spaces between
regA, the comma and regB.

You can locate your code wherever in the 8-bit address space you want. In order
to change the location where a specific piece of code will be stored,
use the .start macro, whose syntax is described below:

.start [address]

Note that base-10 is used for instructions that accept addresses as operands
(like JMP, CALL, BNE, BEQ and .start).

TODO: Allow any radix to be used. (Especially hex)

Comments can be added by prefixing a line with an apostrophe (').

TODO: Make syntax more flexible
